# Pycharm Installation and Setup

We will use the PyCharm IDE. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) gives 
you the ability to write code, run it, test it, and lint it all in one place. By
standardizing the IDE across the lab, we hope to make it easier for you to work 
on code together as well as making it easier for the staff to provide support
if you run into problems.

#### Installation

As students, you can get PyCharm for free by 
[signing up for a student account.](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)


Once you have signed up for an account, you can
[download Pycharm.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
Make sure that you get the Professional Edition.

The installation process differs slightly between Mac and Windows but it should
be straightforward.
